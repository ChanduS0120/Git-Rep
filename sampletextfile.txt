we have git remote repository - nothing but kind of storage like project files etc remotly
locat repository - the repository/folder in our local computer
working directory - current working directory / not added any git commands
Staging area - 


created a folder in desktop
initialized git to this folder using command - 'git init'
created a text file in it 
git status - shown this text file is in untracked due to we dint applied any git commands on it
right now this text file is in 'working directory'
create a python file and check git status still it will show 2 untracked files now
suppose if your computer was creashed - we should not lost our files - so we need to store in remote repository
If we want to move our files from 'local repository' to 'remote repository' first we move to 'staging area' from 'working directory' 

working directory -----git add----->  Stagging area (only one file will add at a time)
Stagging area     -----git commit-->  Local repo  (batch of files will commit/move)
Local repo        -----git push---->  Remote repo   (batch of files push/add )

 example:
> git add filename (file from 'working directory' to 'Stagging area')
> git commit -m "give message here" (files are commited from 'Stagging' to 'Local repository')

Now create a Remote repository - in chrome github - create an account if you dont have - there create a remote repository 
then add this remote repository to the commandline " git remote add origin https://github.com/ChanduS0120/Git-Rep.git"
then push the files to the branch

git checkout - used to navigate or create brances
git checkout -b "branchname" - creating new branch
git checkout branchname - used to navigate to that branch

now navigate to the created new branch "Copy1" - git checkout Copy1
git branch - to know which branch we are
then add the files from working directory to Stagging area of branch Copy1
git add sampletextfile.txt

now commit this file to Local repository of that branch 
git commit -m "moving file from stagging to local rep of branch Copy1"

now push these changes to remote repository from this branch Copy1
git push - it will suggest the git push command
git push --set--upstream origin Copy1 - file moved from local to remote repository

now Copy1 branch will be added tot he main branch
now if we want to add changes from Copy1 file to main branch - create "Pull request"
then after creating PR the Lead or Architect will review the PR.
once approved , they will merge this PR (changes) to main branch
